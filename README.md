<h3>Description</h3>
<p>This repository serves as a platform for React Project for Beginners participants who are on their journey to mastering React JS and want to contribute during Hacktoberfest. It's a place where you can share your mini-projects, learn from others, and contribute to the growth of the open-source community.</p>
<p>Whether you've built a simple calculator, a to-do list, or a weather app, your contributions are welcomed here. The main goal of this repository is to encourage learning and collaboration among developers who are new to React and open-source contributions.</p>

<h3>What is Hacktoberfest?</h3>
<p>Hacktoberfest is a month-long celebration of open-source software run by DigitalOcean. It's open to everyone in our global community. Whether youâ€™re a developer, a student learning to code, an event host, or a company of any size, you can help drive the growth of open-source and make positive contributions to an ever-growing community. All backgrounds and skill levels are encouraged to complete the challenge.</p>

<h3>Repo-Size Management Guidelines</h3>
<p>This repository hosts multiple projects, and to ensure smooth performance and efficient management, the following guidelines must be followed:</p>

<h4>1. Project Size Limitation</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Each individual project folder should <strong>not exceed 15 MB</strong>.</li>
    <li>If a project requires more space due to additional assets or data, consider refactoring the code or storing external files in a separate location (such as cloud storage or GitHub Pages).</li>
</ul>

<h4>2. File Organization</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Projects should be organized in clearly labeled folders under the root directory.</li>
    <li>Keep the folder structure simple, e.g., <code>Project_name1/</code>, <code>Project_name2/</code>, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h4>3. Avoid Large Binary Files</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Do <strong>not</strong> commit large binary files (e.g., videos, high-resolution images, compiled executables) directly to the repository.</li>
    <li>Use <a href="https://git-lfs.github.com/">Git LFS (Large File Storage)</a> for files larger than <strong>100 MB</strong> or consider storing large assets outside the repository and linking to them.</li>
</ul>

<h4>4. Minimize External Libraries</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Minimize the use of heavy third-party libraries or external dependencies.</li>
    <li>Use a <code>.gitignore</code> file to exclude unnecessary or autogenerated files (e.g., <code>node_modules/</code>, <code>build/</code>, etc.).</li>
</ul>

<h4>5. Regular Cleanup</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Perform regular cleanup of unnecessary files (e.g., logs, temporary files).</li>
    <li>Remove outdated or unused code, assets, or projects from the repository.</li>
</ul>

<h4>6. Compression of Assets</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Image Compression</strong>: Use tools like <a href="https://tinypng.com/">TinyPNG</a>, <a href="https://imageoptim.com/">ImageOptim</a>, or <a href="https://squoosh.app/">Squoosh</a> to compress images (PNG, JPEG, etc.) before committing them.</li>
    <li><strong>For Web Images</strong>: Use appropriate formats like <strong>WebP</strong> to significantly reduce size without compromising quality.</li>
    <li><strong>SVG Usage</strong>: Use <strong>SVG</strong> files whenever possible for vector graphics, as they are scalable and lightweight.</li>
    <li>Compress other assets like PDFs and audio files using lossless compression tools before adding them to the repository to reduce file size.</li>
</ul>

<h4>7. Optimize Code for Performance</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Bundle and Minify</strong>: Ensure your project setup uses tools like Webpack or Vite to bundle and minify JavaScript and CSS files. This reduces file sizes and speeds up load times.</li>
    <li><strong>Tree Shaking</strong>: When using third-party libraries, make sure to only import the necessary parts (tree-shaking) to avoid bundling unused code.</li>
    <li>For example, prefer <code>import { Button } from 'library'</code> instead of <code>import * as Library from 'library'</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h4>8. Versioning and History Management</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Keep commit history clean by avoiding frequent commits of unnecessary files.</li>
    <li>Use meaningful and concise commit messages.</li>
    <li>If a project becomes too large over time, consider splitting it into a separate repository.</li>
</ul>

<h4>9. Contributions</h4>
<ul>
    <li>For contributors, please adhere to the project size limits. Large contributions should be discussed through an issue or a pull request.</li>
    <li>Ensure all contributions are optimized for size and performance before submitting them.</li>
</ul>
