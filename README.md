<h1>React Project for Beginners Repository</h1>

Welcome to the React Project for Beginners Repository! This is a special place for beginners who are passionate about learning and contributing to open-source projects using React JS.
Its Hacktoberfest currently!
<h3>NOTE#1: PLEASE CHECK YOUR PROJECT CAREFULLY, IT SHOULD BE ERROR-FREE, YOUR PROJECT WILL BE REVIEWED, IF THE REVIEWER FOUND ANY ERROR YOUR REQUEST WILL MARKED AS "INVALID".<h3>

<h3>NOTE#2: DON'T FORGET TO LIST YOUR PROJECT IN THE `projects.js` FILE IN THE ROOT FOLDER OF THE REPO. YOU CAN ALSO ADD THE DEMO LINK OF YOUR PROJECT(IF ANY)<h3>
<h3>NOTE #3: Please read the <a href="https://github.com/ianshulx/React-projects-for-beginners/blob/main/Repo_Size_Guidelines">Repo-Size Management Guidelines</a>.</h3>

  
<h3>Description</h3>

This repository serves as a platform for React Project for Beginners participants who are on their journey to mastering React JS and want to contribute per Hacktoberfest. It's a place where you can share your mini-projects, learn from others, and contribute to the growth of the open-source community.

Whether you've built a simple calculator, a to-do list, or a weather app, your contributions are welcomed here. The main goal of this repository is to encourage learning and collaboration among developers who are new to React and open-source contributions.

<h3>What is Hacktoberfest?</h3>

Hacktoberfest is a month-long celebration of open-source software run by DigitalOcean. It's open to everyone in our global community. Whether you’re a developer, a student learning to code, an event host, or a company of any size, you can help drive the growth of open-source and make positive contributions to an ever-growing community. All backgrounds and skill levels are encouraged to complete the challenge.

<h3>Contribution Guidelines</h3>
Please make sure to follow the contribution guidelines before making a pull request. Quality contributions are what make the open-source community an amazing place to learn, inspire, and create.

<h3> Repo-Size Management Guidelines</h3>

This repository hosts multiple projects, and to ensure smooth performance and efficient management, the following guidelines must be followed:

## 1. Project Size Limitation
- Each individual project folder should **not exceed 15 MB**.
- If a project requires more space due to additional assets or data, consider refactoring the code or storing external files in a separate location (such as cloud storage or GitHub Pages).

## 2. File Organization
- Projects should be organized in clearly labeled folders under the root directory.
- Keep the folder structure simple, e.g., `Project_name1/`, `Project_name2/`, etc.

## 3. Avoid Large Binary Files
- Do **not** commit large binary files (e.g., videos, high-resolution images, compiled executables) directly to the repository.
- Use [Git LFS (Large File Storage)](https://git-lfs.github.com/) for files larger than **100 MB** or consider storing large assets outside the repository and linking to them.

## 4. Minimize External Libraries
- Minimize the use of heavy third-party libraries or external dependencies.
- Use a `.gitignore` file to exclude unnecessary or autogenerated files (e.g., `node_modules/`, `build/`, etc.).

## 5. Regular Cleanup
- Perform regular cleanup of unnecessary files (e.g., logs, temporary files).
- Remove outdated or unused code, assets, or projects from the repository.

## 6. Compression of Assets
- **Image Compression**: Use tools like [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/), [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/), or [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app/) to compress images (PNG, JPEG, etc.) before committing them.
  - **For Web Images**: Use appropriate formats like **WebP** to significantly reduce size without compromising quality.
- **Limit Resolution**: Avoid using high-resolution images unnecessarily. For most React projects, a resolution of 72 DPI (dots per inch) is sufficient for the web.
- **SVG Usage**: Use **SVG** files whenever possible for vector graphics, as they are scalable and lightweight.
- Compress other assets like PDFs and audio files using lossless compression tools before adding them to the repository to reduce file size.

## 7. Optimize Code for Performance
- **Bundle and Minify**: Ensure your project setup uses tools like Webpack or Vite to bundle and minify JavaScript and CSS files. This reduces file sizes and speeds up load times.
- **Tree Shaking**: When using third-party libraries, make sure to only import the necessary parts (tree-shaking) to avoid bundling unused code.
  - For example, prefer `import { Button } from 'library'` instead of `import * as Library from 'library'`.

## 8. Versioning and History Management
- Keep commit history clean by avoiding frequent commits of unnecessary files.
- Use meaningful and concise commit messages.
- If a project becomes too large over time, consider splitting it into a separate repository.

## 9. Contributions
- For contributors, please adhere to the project size limits. Large contributions should be discussed through an issue or a pull request.
- Ensure all contributions are optimized for size and performance before submitting them.
